<p> <code>adult</code> 데이터 내에는 많은 경우의 수를 가진 범주형 변수들이 있으므로 먼저 <code>model.matrix()</code> 함수를 통해 범주형 변수들을 <code>dummy variable</code> 들로 변환시켜 주어야 합니다.</p>
<p> 추후 모델을 훈련시켜주는 함수가 이런 과정을 자동으로 하여주지만 만약 데이터를 train, validation, test로 분리할 때, 이 분리된 3개의 데이터 세트 중 어느 하나가 특정 범주형 변수 내 경우의 값을 포함하지 않을 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 <code>native_country</code> 변수에는 42개의 국가들이 있는데 데이터를 분리할 때 어느 한 데이터세트에 이 42개 국가 중 어떤 특정 국가의 정보가 전혀 들어가지 않을 수 있습니다. 이럴 경우 모델 학습, 평가 진행간 데이터의 구조가 서로 달라 오류를 발생할 수 있습니다.</p>
<p> 그래서 아에 처음부터 <code>model.matrix()</code> 함수를 이용해 데이터의 구조를 동일하게 맞추어 주는 것이 좋습니다.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># wage 변수는 목적변수이므로 model.matrix() 함수를 적용할 땐 제외합니다.
model.matrix(~ . -wage, adult ) %&gt;%

<p> 데이터를 분리할 때 이런 <code>unbalanced</code> 데이터 같은 경우는 분리한 후에도 이런 비율이 어느정도 일치하게 분리하는 것이 필요합니다. 지금 예에선 <span class="math inline">\(&lt;=50K\)</span> : <span class="math inline">\(&gt;50K\)</span> 가 3:1 정도의 비율을 나타냅니다. 그래서 <code>train_data</code>에서도 3:1, <code>validation_data</code>에서도 3:1, <code>test_data</code>에서도 3:1의 비율이 유지되도록 분리하여 진행하는 것이 좋습니다.</p>
<p> 그래서 저는 주로 <code>caret::creatDataPartition()</code>이란 함수를 자주 이용합니다. 지금부터는 이 함수를 이용해 <code>train_data:validation_data:test_data</code>를 전체 데이터 크기에서 각각 6:2:2로 분리해되 각 분리된 세트 내 목적변수 <code>wage의</code> 비율은 3:1로 유지하면 분리하도록 하겠습니다.</p>

<p> 자 그럼 한번 로지스틱 회귀모델을 훈련시켜 보겠습니다. 이 때 사용하는 함수는 glm() 함수입니다. 이 때 <code>family</code> 인자 값을 binomial로 하면 로지스틱 회귀모델이 생성됩니다.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>adult_logistic_m &lt;- glm(wage ~ ., data = train_data_1, family = binomial)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>adult_logistic_m &lt;- glm(wage ~ ., data = train_data_1, family = &#39;binomial&#39;)</code></pre>
<p> family = binomial와 같이 binomial에 따옴표를 붙이지 않고 작성해도 되고 family = “binomial”와 같이 따옴표를 붙여서 작성해도 됩니다.</p>
<p> 위의 모델에 summary() 함수를 취하면 다음과 같은 결과를 얻습니다.</p>

<p> 이제 우리가 만든 모델의 성능이 얼마나 되는지 알아보겠습니다. 이는 val_data의 목적변수의 값과 예측값을 서로 비교함으로써 가능합니다. 여기서 예측값을 계산할 때에는 predict() 함수를 사용하고, 이 함수의 type 인자값을 response로 지정합니다. 그러면 새로운 데이터에 대한 로지스틱 곡선의 함수값을 계산하여 결과적으로 목적변수가 1이 되는 확률값을 반환합니다.</p>

<p> 지금까지 validation data를 이용해 우리가 생성한 logistic regression 모델의 성능을 알아보았습니다. 보통은 cross validation 이라는 기법을 적용해 validaion data들에 대한 모델의 성능을 평가합니다. cross validation에 대해서는 별도의 post를 통해 자세히 설명할 예정입니다. 다만 간단히 개념적으로만 살펴보자면, 지금까지 한 것처럼 validation data 세트를 한 개만 만들지 말고 여러 개를 만들어 각각의 validation data들로 모델의 성능을 평가 후 그 성능을 평균하여 최종 모덜의 성능을 예측한다는 개념입니다.</p>
<p> 좀 더 구체적으로 예를 들어보겠습니다. 지금처럼 데이터를 6:2:2 분리하여 진행하는 것이 아니라, 처음에는 8:2로분리하여 train data와 test_data를 분리하고 분리된 train data를 10개의 fold들로 나누어 9개는 훈련용 데이터로 사용하고 1개는 검증용 데이터로 사용하는데 이 때 10개로 나뉘어진 fold들의 순서를 순차적으로 바꾸어 훈련용 데이터와 검증용 데이터를 바꾸어줍니다. 총 10번의 반복된 모델 훈련과 검증을 통해 보다 객관적인 모델의 성능을 검증하는 방법이라고 할 수 있습니다.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-04-30-Logistic_Regression_Example_with_Adult_Dataset_files/train_val_test.png" /></p>
<p> 여기서 잠깐 생각해 보겠습니다. validation data와 test data와의 차이점은 무엇일까요? test data는 모델의 ‘최종 성능’ 을 평가하기 위해서 쓰입니다. 일종의 <code>최후의 보류</code>라고나 할까요? 우리의 지금 예에서는 logistic regression 하나의 알고리즘만을 사용했습니다. 하지만 보통은 여러 machine learning 알고리즘들을 같은 데이터에 적용해 최적의 알고리즘을 찾으려고 노력합니다. 이 때 각각의 다른 알고리즘으로 생성된 모델의 성능을 검증하는데 사용하는데 사용하는 data가 바로 validation data입니다.</p>
<p> validation data와 test data와의 가장 큰 차이는 validation data는 모델 training의 과정에 관여하지만 test data는 그렇지 않다는 차이가 있습니다. 반면 validation data는 여러 모델 중에서 최종 모델을 선정하기 위한 성능 평가에 관여합니다. 따라서 validation data는 training과정에 관여하게 됩니다. 즉, validation data는 training 과정에 관여를 하며, training이 된 여러가지 모델 중 가장 좋은 하나의 모델을 고르기 위한 데이터입니다. test data는 모든 training 과정이 완료된 후에 최종적으로 모델의 성능을 평가하기 위한 데이터인 것입니다.</p>
<p> 만약 test data가 모델을 개선하는데 쓰인다면, 그건 test data가 아니라 validation data입니다. test data가 이런식으로 모델 훈련 과정에 관여하게 된다면 test data에 대한 overfitting을 방지할 수도 없고 정확한 accuracy를 예측할 수도 없게 됩니다.</p>

<p> 이제 그 동안 꼬옥꼬옥 숨겨왔던 test data를 이용해 예측이란걸 해 보겠습니다.</p>
